# Multi-Tenant SaaS Notes Application

A modern, multi-tenant SaaS application for managing notes with role-based access control and subscription management.

## Multi-Tenancy Architecture

**Chosen Approach: Shared Schema with Tenant ID Column**

This application uses a shared schema approach where all data is stored in the same tables but isolated using a `tenantId` column. This approach offers:

- **Cost Efficiency**: Single database instance for all tenants
- **Simplified Maintenance**: One schema to maintain and backup
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new tenants without infrastructure changes
- **Security**: Strict tenant isolation through application-level filtering

### Data Isolation Strategy

- Every data model includes a `tenantId` field
- All queries are automatically filtered by the current user's tenant
- Role-based access control ensures users can only access their tenant's data
- localStorage simulation maintains tenant boundaries in the frontend

## Features

- **State Management**: React hooks with localStorage persistence
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **UI Components**: Radix UI + shadcn/ui
- **Authentication**: JWT simulation
- **Data Storage**: localStorage (for development/demo)
